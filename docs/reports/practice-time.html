<h3>Tracking students' practice time</h3>
<p>If you have a subscription to TypingClub School Edition, you will have access to advanced reporting tools that break down your students' time spent practicing. This is especially useful if you prefer to grade students based on how much time they spend practicing their typing.</p>

<h4>School-Based Time Reports</h4>
<p>To view the practice time for a school, go to the <span class="tab">Reports</span> tab and open the <span class="tab">Schools</span> tab. There you can use the filters to view aggregate school data for a selected time frame, show the growth on detailed view, and export the report into a spreadsheet.</p>
