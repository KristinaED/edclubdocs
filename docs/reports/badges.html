<h1>Badges</h1>
<p>Students automatically earn badges upon reaching certain goals, such as a 5-day typing streak, or completing 10 passing attempts in a day. Each badge has the opportunity to be "leveled up".  For example, once a student earns the 5-day streak badge, they will be eligible to earn the 14-day streak badge. </p> 

<p>See a <a target="blank" href="https://s.typingclub.com/view_update/badges-for-students.html">full list of badges</a> that your students can earn.</p>

<p>On the student side, badges are displayed on their own page so students can always view what they have earned and what their next goal is. Teachers can view the badges that students earned by visiting the <b>Overview</b> section of their profile page. The badges are displayed at the top of the overview page. To see when the badge was earned, look at the <b>Badges</b> column under the <b>Activity Attempts</b> tab. A class-wide badge report is not available at this time.</p><br/>
