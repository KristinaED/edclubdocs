<p>TypingClub School Edition offers a rich set of tools to monitor students' typing progress. Below you can find the best places to check your students' overall progress.</p>

      <h2>Scoreboard<span class="icon-free"></span></b><br></h2>
      The scoreboard summarizes your students' overall progress on a given lesson plan and allows you to simultaneously view several important details about your students. You will see every student's star count, total practice time, average accuracy, average WPM, overall progress, and other details. To access the scoreboard, follow the next steps:<br/><br/>
      <ol>
         <li>Go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and open your class.</li>
         <li>Click the lesson plan tab of your choice.</li>
         <li>Click <b>Scoreboard</b>. Your students' scores will show up on this page after they complete their first lesson.</li>
         <li>If you click the blue <b>Per Lesson</b> box, you will see the statistics for each lesson per individual student.</li>
      </ol>
      You control whether your students can see the scoreboard on their student portal. This setting encourages competition among students by ranking them according to their star count.<br/><br/>

   <li>
      <h2>Attempt history <span class="icon-free"></span></b><br></h2>
      The Attempt History will show you each individual attempt on this lesson plan arranged chronologically. Each lesson plan has its own scoreboard, and the progress made on each lesson plan is recorded independently. To access the lesson attempt history, go to:<br/><br/>
      <ol>
         <li>Go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and open your class.</li>
         <li>Click the lesson plan tab of your choice.</li>
         <li>Click <b>Attempt History</b>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The blue buttons on the right side of this window are worth noting: </p>
      <ul>
         <li>The <b>X</b> in each row allows you to delete a specific attempt, which is useful if you believe a student cheated on the attempt by having a parent or friend complete the lesson.</li>
         <li>The <b>Play button</b> in each row shows a video replay of an attempt. You can view exactly what the student typed and see where he or she made mistakes.</li>
         <li>The <b>Eye button</b> allows you to view a snapshot of an attempt without having to watch the replay.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h2>Student progress overview <span class="icon-pro"></span></h2>
      Student Progress is a graphic bird's eye view of your students' performance on all lessons in a given lesson plan. To access it, go to:<br/><br/>
      <ol>
         <li>Go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and open your class.</li>
         <li>Click the lesson plan tab of your choice.</li>
         <li>Click <b>Student Progress</b>.</li>
      </ol>
      The color blue indicates a student achieving five stars, and the shades of gray indicate getting four or fewer stars. In the left column, you can find the list of your students, while the top row shows a list of the lessons in this lesson plan. You can identify which students are mastering each lesson and which need to go back and repeat certain lessons. Ideally, students will earn 5 stars on all lessons and you will see a solid blue line next to each student's name.<br/><br/>

      <h2>Lesson plan completion rate<span class="icon-free"></span></b><br></h2>
      This graph shows the percentage of the lesson plan that the student completed with respect to the rest of the class. It helps you easily assess if the student is keeping up with their peers.  To access it, go to:<br/> <b>Students</b> <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span><b> Your Student</b> <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span><b> Overview </b><span class="icon-right-arrow"></span><b> Lesson Plan Completion Rate</b><br/><br/>
