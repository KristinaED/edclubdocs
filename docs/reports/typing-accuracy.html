<p>If you have a subscription to TypingClub School Edition, you will have access to advanced reporting tools to monitor your students' progress in terms of accuracy. Accuracy is calculated in two ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Accuracy</b>: Accuracy shows the final accuracy while taking into account all corrections made during typing practice. This value is generally higher than the real accuracy.</li><br>
	<li><b>Real Accuracy</b>: This is the raw, uncorrected accuracy. Even if the use of backspace is allowed, this value shows the percentage of text that was typed without any mistakes in the first place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both accuracy and real accuracy are calculated automatically. Real accuracy is considered to be a better indicator of students' typing skills.

<li><h4>School-based accuracy reports</h4>
<p>To assess the typing accuracy of your school, go to the <span class="tab">Reports</span> tab and open the <span class="tab">Schools</span> tab. There you can use the filters to view aggregate school data for a selected time frame, show the growth on detailed view, and export the report into a spreadsheet.</p>
