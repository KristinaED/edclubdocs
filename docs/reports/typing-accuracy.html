<h3>Tracking students' typing accuracy</h3>
<p>If you have a subscription to TypingClub School Edition, you will have access to advanced reporting tools to monitor your students' progress in terms of accuracy. Accuracy is calculated in two ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Accuracy</b>: Accuracy shows the final accuracy while taking into account and not penalizing students for corrections made during typing practice. This value is generally higher than the real accuracy.</li><br>
	<li><b>Real Accuracy</b>: This is the raw, uncorrected accuracy. Even if the use of backspace is allowed, this value shows the percentage of text that was typed without mistakes in the first place.</li>
</ul>

<h4>School-Based Accuracy Reports</h4>
<p>To assess the typing accuracy of your school, go to the <span class="tab">Reports</span> tab and open the <span class="tab">Schools</span> tab. There you can use the filters to view aggregate school data for a selected time frame, show the growth on detailed view, and export the report into a spreadsheet.</p>
