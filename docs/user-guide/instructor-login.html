<H1>How do instructors log in?</H1>
</br>
<p> If you are an instructor trying to log in, you must enter your customized URL in your browser's address bar. You will know this URL because you have either created it yourself or you have been added to an account with an existing URL. If you were added to an account, you will receive an email inviting you to create your password and log in to your TypingClub from the portal URL selected by your account administrator.</p>

<p>Once you are on the login page specific to your school or district, enter your email address as your username and your password and click <mark>Sign in</mark>.</p>

<div class="doc-tip">
    <b>Single Sign On:</b>
    If your profile was created using a Google, Microsoft 365, Clever, or ClassLink email address, you can use the corresponding single sign on option.

<h4>A few things to keep in mind:</h4>
<ul> 
<li>Teachers cannot add themselves to an existing school account. The district/school admin must add teachers to the account.</li>
<li>Teachers always log in with their email address and password.</li>
<li>The account admin can set different permissions for each teacher. If you're unsure about what you can and can't do, reach out to your account admin for further information.</li>
</ul>
