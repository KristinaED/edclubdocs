<H1>How do I install the iPad app?</H1>
</br>
<p>TypingClub is available for students who prefer to learn touch typing on iPads. The app can be found in the App Store under EdClub.</p>

<p>The first time students open the EdClub app using an iPad, they will be prompted to enter a school code. The school code is the first part of your school's login URL. </p>

<p>For example, if your school's login URL is <b> https://<mark>schoolname</mark>.typingclub.com</b>, then your school code is <b><mark>schoolname</b></mark></b>.</p>
