<h3>Exporting Student List</h3>
<p>If you would like to export students from your TypingClub account to a CSV file, you can do so by going to the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab on the left side of the screen. This can be useful if you'd like to update your student records without starting over from the beginning. You can filter this list by school, class, or grade using the filter options. You can select multiple options for each filter.</p>

<p>Click <b>Export CSV</b> and save the file to your computer. You now have a file of your students in CSV format.</p>
