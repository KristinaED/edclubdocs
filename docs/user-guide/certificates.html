<h2>How do I issue typing certificates?</h2>
<p>Instructors can award certificates to students who either finish a test or meet a passing requirement for a test.</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <h4>Option 1</h4>
      <p>Everyone who completes the test will both pass and be issued a certificate. This is useful if you are doing a placement test that doesn't have passing requirements.</p>
      <p>An easy way to check if your certificates are turned on is to see if you have a tab titled <span class="tab">Print Certificates</span> on the <span class="tab">test management</span> page:</p>

   </br>
   </br>
   <li>
      <h4>Option 2</h4>
      <p>Students must meet the passing requirements in order to be issued a certificate.  The passing requirements can be customized. Please note that certificates cannot be issued retroactively.</p>

<p>As of November 2016, certificates are issued by default. If you created a test prior to November 2016, your certificates might not be turned on. You can edit your preferences by going to <span class="tab">Typing Tests</span>, and clicking the <b>Edit Options</b> tab on the top. Among some other customizable settings, this page allows you to see if the <b>Certificates of Achievement</b> option is checked.</p>

   <b>Warning:</b>
   Issuing certificates retroactively is not possible. Always remember to check the settings before your students take a test. Whenever you make changes, do not forget to click <b>Update Options</b> on the bottom of the page.
