<h2>Scoreboard & Leaderboard Settings</h2>
<p>Scoreboard is one of the motivational tools offered on TypingClub School Edition. It allows students to view each others' scores and try to outperform each other to grab the highest spot. If you prefer that students focus on their own individual performance instead, you can turn the scoreboard off.</p>
<h3>How do  teachers activate the scoreboard?</h3>
<p>To turn off the scoreboard, go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and select your class. Under the <br/><span class="tab">Manage Class</span> tab, click on <b>Edit Class</b>; (the 5th option from the left).

<h3> How do teachers monitor the scoreboard?</h3>
<p>The scoreboard is a powerful tool that allows you to simultaneously view important details about all of your students. On one page, you will see every student's star count, total practice time, average accuracy, average WPM, overall progress, and other details. </p>
<p>To access the scoreboard, go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab, click on your class, and click on <b>Scoreboard</b>. Your students&rsquo; scores will show up on this page after they complete each lesson. If you click on the blue box titled <b>Per Lesson</b> at the end of each line, you will access the student's statistics for each individual lesson. </p>
