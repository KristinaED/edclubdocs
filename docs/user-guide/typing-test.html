<h1>How do I create a typing test?</h1>
</br>
<p>Typing Tests allow you to monitor your students&rsquo; performance in a timed examination where they have to type large quantities of text. This presents an alternative to the short lessons and can help prepare students for standardized tests like the Common Core.</p>

<h3>How to Create a Typing Test</h3>
<p>Go to the <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Typing Tests</span> tab and click &ldquo;Add a Typing Test.&rdquo; After you give the test a name and a brief description, you will be able to customize several settings. To better understand whether a certain test will be a good fit for your students, we recommend taking the test yourself before assigning it to a class.</p>
<p class='well'><b class="ed-bold-txt">NOTE: </b>The default typing text is very long. We do not recommend assigning the entire default text to new students, because doing so would likely be too demanding.</p>
<h3>The &quot;Edit Text&quot; Tab</h3>
<p>You are able to change the text students will be asked to type during the test, or you can use one of the existing templates that we have prepared for you.</p>
<h3>The &quot;Edit Options&quot; Tab</h3>
<p>You can edit several details about the test. Most of these features are fairly self-explanatory, but two of them deserve a quick explanation. </p>
<h5>Time-Based Test</h5>
<p>If you make the test time-based, students will have a designated amount of time to type as much of the text as they can. The test will then calculate WPM and accuracy based on their performance.</p>
<h5>Who Should Take This Test?</h5>
<p>If you select &ldquo;Only the students I select&rdquo;, you will need to manually choose students to take the test. To do this, click on &ldquo;Students&rdquo; and search for each student individually, or assign the test to an entire class. <br>If you select &ldquo;Any student in my school&rdquo;, the students from your school will need to sign up for the test from their student portal. When they log in, they will see a button labeled &ldquo;Add more activities (1)&rdquo;.  They must click this button to access the test. <br> If you select &ldquo;Any student in my account&rdquo;, your students will need to sign up for the test from their student portal. When they log in, they will see a button labeled &ldquo;Add more activities (1)&rdquo;.  They must click this button to access the test.</p>
<h3>The &quot;Test Results&quot; Tab</h3>
<p> You can see and export students&rsquo; scores on the test from this menu. This screen shows your students' best scores for the test. You can export a full log of your students' attempts by clicking the &quot;Export Attempts&quot; button.
</p>
<h3>The &quot;Print Certificates&quot; Tab</h3>
<p>Typing Club now offers the option to print certificates of achievement at the end of a typing test. 
As of November 2016, the certificates are issued by default. To ensure the option is turned on, the &quot;Print Certificates&quot; tab should appear on your top navigation bar. <br>
For tests created prior, go back to "Edit Option" and turn the certificates of achievement on.  
You can export the certificates in a friendly PDF format and print them to provide further motivation for your students. </p>

 
<p>If you need to deactivate the test or to see general info about your test, use the <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Overview</span> tab.</p>

<p>You have now finished creating your test! Next, you can assign students to take it.</p>
