<h2>How do districts add multiple schools? <span class="icon-pro"</span></h2>

<p>If you're setting up your account for the whole district, you may want to add all schools at once.</p>

<p>Start by clicking the  <span class="btn btn-primary">Settings</span> tab on the left side of the page, and choosing the Data Import Tool.</p>

<p>Here you will see instructions on how to create and upload your .csv file. If you click Schools on the right-hand side of the screen, you'll be able to download a template.</p> 

<p>Once you insert your information into the template, you can use the Choose File button to upload it. Your file might take a few minutes to process, and you will see it labeled Processing on the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>Once it has been processed, your schools will automatically be added to your Schools section in the main menu.</p>
