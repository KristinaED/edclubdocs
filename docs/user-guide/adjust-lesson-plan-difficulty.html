<h1>How do I adjust the lesson plan difficulty?</h1>
</br>
<p>If the difficulty of your lesson plan does not match the skill level of your students, you can change the difficulty level of the lessons in terms of accuracy and/or words per minute.</p>

<p>To quickly change the difficulty of a lesson plan, go to <b>Classes > Your class > Lesson Plans</b>. You'll see an overview of the lesson plans assigned to the class. Under the "Adjust Difficulty" column, you can adjust the difficulty of the lesson plan to have a higher or lower word per minute or accuracy requirement:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Adjusting speed:</b> To adjust the speed requirement for your class, input the adjustment value to increase or decrease the level of difficulty for your students. For example, if your current speed goal is 15 WPM and you'd like to raise it to 20 WPM, adjust the value by +5 WPM.</li>
<li><b>Adjusting accuracy:</b> The value set here will be the minimum accuracy required to pass all lessons in the lesson plan. The goal accuracy of 100% is implied. </li>
</ul>
<p>Click the "Update" button and you will see the new requirement reflected in the overview of the lesson plan.</p>
