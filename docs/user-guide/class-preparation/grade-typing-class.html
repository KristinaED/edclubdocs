<h2>Grading Suggestions</h2>
<p>The amount of time required to master touch typing varies and depends on multiple factors. Fundamentally, the goal is to build the muscle memory which allows the typist to forget about how to type and focus on what they're typing instead. If you are unsure of how to grade your students, we suggest three approaches that have worked well for teachers in the past:</p>
<ul>
   <li><h3>Practice Time</h3>
   Grade students based on the amount of time they spend practicing typing on a daily or weekly basis. Helpful time-based reports can be found under <b>Classes <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> Your class <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> Reports.</b></li>

   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
      <h3>Stars</h3>
      Grade students based on the number of stars they earn on each lesson. The more stars students receive, the better their standing on the scoreboard. The scoreboard is unique to each lesson plan, you can find it under <b>Classes <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> Your class <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> Your lesson plan <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> Scoreboard.</b></li>

   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
      <h3>Typing Test <span class="icon-pro"></span></h3>
      Grade students based on their scores on Typing Tests. The <b>Test Results</b> page shows the best attempt for each student. The list can be reorganized by clicking any of the headers.</li>
