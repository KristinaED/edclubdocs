   Choose the account of your choice and fill out a simple form containing information about your school and yourself. TypingClub is available in <a target='_blank' href="https://s.typingclub.com/schools/pricing.html">two editions</a> including one that's completely free.
</p>
<p> The program allows you to choose your login URL. This is the URL everyone in your account will use to log in. The school URL usually has the following format: https://<b>schoolname</b>.typingclub.com</p>

<h2>How do teachers join an existing account?</h2>
<p> If your school or district has already created an account with a custom URL, you do not need to make your own account. Instead, contact the account administrator to be added to the existing account.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Is there a free trial? </h2>
<p> Yes. TypingClub offers a 60-day free trial of the Pro Edition. Please choose this option if you want to explore all the advanced features TypingClub has to offer, completely ad-free. Don't worry, we never ask for your credit card information. If you decide to continue using the free version, your account will automatically downgrade to the free edition at the end of the trial period, and the transition will be absolutely seamless.</p>
