<h3>Adding Many Classes</h3>
<p>When setting up a larger account, you may wish to use our Data Import Tool to add multiple classes at once instead of adding them manually.</p>

<div class="doc-tip">
    <b>Tip:</b>
    Before adding new classes, check your default lesson plan (Typing Jungle is assigned by default). This is the lesson plan that will be assigned to all newly created classes. To find this, go to "Lesson Plans" and then Lesson Plan Settings.
</div>

<p>Once you've checked your default lesson plan, please go to "Settings" and scroll down to click the "Data Import Tool". Here you can see the link on the right side of the screen titled "Classes". Clicking this link will give you information for required fields in the classes.csv file. You can download a template by clicking "Download Class CSV Template File".</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the fields required for a successful upload:</p>
<ol>
<li> Required fields:</li>
<ul>
    <li><b>class-id:</b> your internal ID, no special form is required </li>
    <li><b>instructor-id:</b> your internal ID, no special form is required</li>
    <li><b>school-id:</b> required only if you have more than one school, no special form is required</li>
    <li><b>name:</b> your internal class name</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li> Optional fields: </li>
<ul>
    <li><b>description:</b> will help if you need to remember the purpose of each class</li>
    <li><b>grade:</b> including a grade the will help you more easily sort through your classes in the future</li>
    <li><b>action:</b> use the word "update" for all rows in your spreadsheet to add or update classes, or the word "delete" to remove them. </li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>Once you have created your CSV file, make sure to save it, return to the Data Import Tool page, and upload the file. Uploading may take a couple of minutes depending on the size of the file. Check the <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Classes</span> tab to make sure the classes from your spreadsheet have populated in your account.</p> 

<div class="doc-warn">
    <b>Note:</b>
    Keep in mind that you still have to enroll your students in their classes. By assigning IDs to your classes, you can create and enroll your students at the same time. Just be sure to include the class ID for each student when importing your students.csv file.
