<h2>How do I generate a parent letter?</h2>
<p>A parent letter is a great idea if you expect your students to be practicing in your TypingClub account from home. The parent letter is designed to get parents on board, help them understand the purpose of the software, and to make them comfortable helping their children access the account. The parent letter is a perfect introduction to TypingClub at the beginning of the school year, and it can be sent to parents after the winter break as a reminder of their children's participation in the program. To generate individual parent letters for a class, go to:<br/><b>Classes <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> Your class <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> Parent Letter</b>.<br/><br/> You can edit the text of the parent letter itself and add any custom instructions you might have for parents. When you click <b>Generate PDF</b>, you will see one custom letter for each student in your class. </p>
