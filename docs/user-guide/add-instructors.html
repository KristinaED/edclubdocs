<h3>How do I add one instructor at a time?</h3>
<p>From the <span class="btn btn-primary">Instructors</span> tab, click <mark>Add Instructor</mark>. Provide the instructor's details and click Add Instructor. A welcome email will be sent to the provided email address inviting the teacher to create a password and sign in.</p>
<h3> How do I use the Data Import Tool to upload multiple instructors?</h3>
<p>Start by clicking the <span class="btn btn-primary">Settings</span> tab on the left-hand side of your admin portal and clicking Data Import Tool.</p>
</p>The Data Import Tool is a powerful data processing tool which allows you to upload large amounts of data in a quick and organized manner. Simply prepare your spreadsheet with a .csv extension containing your teachers' information, or download our template  by clicking Download Instructor CSV Template File.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the required and optional fields for a successful upload:</p>

<div class="doc-warn">

    Field titles must match exactly.
</div>

<ol>
<li><h5>Required fields</h5></li>
<ul>
    <li><b>instructor-id:</b> your internal ID, no special form is required</li>
    <li><b>school-id:</b> required only if you have more than one school, no special form is required</li>
    <li><b>first name:</b> teachers' first names are required</li>
    <li><b>email:</b> teachers' email addresses are required. Teachers will use their email address to log in.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><h5>Optional fields</h5></li>
<ul>
    <li><b>last name:</b> will help you more easily sort through your instructor list in the future</li>
    <li><b>phone:</b> will be helpful if you need to be able to quickly contact a teacher.</li>
    <li><b>password:</b> if your CSV doesn't contain teacher passwords, the instructors will be sent an email inviting them to set up their password.</li>
    <li><b>action:</b> use the word "update" for all rows in your spreadsheet to add or update instructors, or the word "delete" to remove them. </li>
</ul>
</br>

<p>Once you have created your CSV file, make sure to save it, return to the Data Import Tool page, and upload the file. Uploading may take a couple of minutes depending on the size of the file. Check the <span class="btn btn-primary">Instructors</span> tab to make sure the teachers from your spreadsheet have populated in your account.</p>
