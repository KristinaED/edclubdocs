<h1>How can change instructor permissions?</h1>
</br>
<p>Instructors in your TypingClub account can be given a number of roles. To review and adjust the permission level, choose the <span class="btn btn-primary">Instructors</span> tab, select an instructor, and go to the <mark>Permissions</mark> tab. You will see the following options:</p> 

<ul>
<li><b class="ed-bold-txt">Account Administrator</b>: has access to change anything in the account.<br> (Note: If you want to make an instructor a school administrator, go to Schools > Select school > Admins.)</li>
<br>
<li><b class="ed-bold-txt">Can access students from all schools</b>: this option is useful if you are managing multiple schools and need to allow a teacher to have access to students from multiple schools.</li>
<br>
<li><b class="ed-bold-txt">Can change class names and IDs</b>: this option allows you to control who can manage the class list.</li>
<br>
<li><b class="ed-bold-txt">Can delete classes</b>: this option allows you to control who can delete classes from the class list.</li>
<br>
<li><b class="ed-bold-txt">Can change student information</b>: this option lets you control who can manage students' information.</li>
</ul>
 <br>

<p>To apply your changes, click <span class="btn btn-primary">Update Permissions</span> and you're all set.</p>
