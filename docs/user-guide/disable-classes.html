    <b>Why disable classes?</b> When you disable a class, students will not be able to access the lesson plans that are assigned to that class. You can use this feature to either hide certain lesson plans from students or to preserve a roster for a later date.
    <br><br>
    <b>Where do they go?</b> Disabled classes are hidden from your class list. To view your disabled classes, click the 'Show Filters' option and then select the box for 'Inactive' or 'Both active and inactive'.
