<h1>How can I adjust lesson difficulty per student?</h1>
</br>
<p>Select the <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Classes</span> tab on the left side of the page. Choose the student's class and then the tab that corresponds to the lesson plan of interest. If you click <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Scoreboard</span>, you will see the list of enrolled students and their ranking in the class.</p>

<p>Find the student, go to the column labeled "Difficulty" and click "Normal Difficulty". You can adjust the difficulty in terms of either accuracy or words per minute (WPM).</p>

<h4>To Adjust the Required Minimum Accuracy</h4>
<p>Enter the minimum accuracy for your students to earn one star. If your students perform below this value,
 they will not pass the lesson.</p>

<h4>To Adjust Difficulty by Words per Minute (WPM)</h4>
<p>Use the arrows to add or subtract from the words per minute requirement for this student. If you change this setting to +1, you will make it more difficult for the student, whereas if you change it -1, you will make it easier.</p>

<p>For example, if a lesson requires a speed of 15 words per minute, adding +1 will require this student to type at a speed of 16 words per minute. This requirement will apply to all lessons in this lesson plan for this student.</p>

<p>We recommend making small changes to the requirements to better gauge the student's skill level.</p>
