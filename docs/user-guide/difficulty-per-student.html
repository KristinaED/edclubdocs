<h2>How can I adjust lesson difficulty per student?</h2>
<p>Select the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab on the left side of the page. Choose the student's class and then the tab that corresponds to the lesson plan of interest. If you click <span class="tab">Scoreboard</span>, you will see the list of enrolled students and their ranking in the class.</p>
<p>Find the student, go to the column labeled <b>Difficulty</b> and click <b>Normal Difficulty</b>. You can adjust the difficulty in terms of either accuracy or words per minute (WPM).</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>
   <h3>Adjust the Required Minimum Accuracy</h3>
   <p>Enter the minimum accuracy for your students to earn one star. If your students perform below this value,
      they will not pass the lesson.
   </p>
</li>
<br/>
<li>
   <h3>Adjust Difficulty by Words per Minute (WPM)</h3>
   <p>Use the arrows to add or subtract from the words per minute requirement for this student. If you change this setting to +1, you will make it more difficult for the student, whereas if you change it -1, you will make it easier.</p>
   <p>For example, if a lesson requires a speed of 15 words per minute, adding +1 will require this student to type at a speed of 16 words per minute. This requirement will apply to all lessons in this lesson plan for this student.</p>
