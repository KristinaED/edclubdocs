<h3>Which lesson plans can I use?</h3>
<p> The various lesson plans offered by TypingClub can be found under <b>Lesson Plans > Lesson Plan Library</b>. The library contains our flag-ship lesson plan Typing Jungle, a short typing course called Typing Basics, a lesson plan for typing Dvorak,  lesson plans for one-handed typists, lesson plans to learn to type in multiple foreign languages, and stories from our Animated Story Typing series called Ava and The Rabbit, Going Solo, and The Perfect Match. Any of these lesson plans can be installed in your account at no additional cost.</p>

<h3>What is my default lesson plan? </h3>
<p>The default lesson plan for every class and account is Typing Jungle. The default lesson plan is the activity that will be automatically assigned to all classes in your account. If you prefer to use a different lesson plan as the default in your account, remember to make the change before you upload your classes. To view or update your default lesson plan, go to <b>Lesson Plans > Default Lesson Plan Settings</b>. Note that you have the ability to assign a different lesson plan to each grade level. </p>

<h3>How do I change the assigned lesson plan after I uploaded my classes?</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Update class assignments individually:</b> Go to Classes > Your class > Lesson Plans and assign/unassign lesson plans. </li>
<li><b>Update class assignments in bulk:</b> Go to Classes > Select all or multiple classes > Bulk Update > Assign/Remove lesson plan. </li>
</ul>
