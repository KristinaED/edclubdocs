<h2>Exporting your student list to a csv file</h2>

<p>If you would like to export students from your TypingClub account to a .csv file, you can do so by going to the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab on the left side of the screen. This can be useful if you'd like to update your student records without starting over from the beginning.</p>

<p>You can filter this list by school, class, or grade using the filter options. You can select multiple options for each filter.</p>

<p>Click Export CSV and save the file on your computer. You now have a file of your students in .csv format.</p> 

<p>Please note that you can delete any unnecessary columns you are not updating, such as the Last Activity or Enrollments columns.</p>
