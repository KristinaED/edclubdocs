<h1>Adjusting the minimum star requirement</h1>
<p">Students' performance on TypingClub is measured in terms of stars. To pass a lesson, students have to earn between 1 to 5 stars. The number of stars awarded at the end of each lesson is determined by their performance on a given exercise (combination of typing speed &amp; accuracy). By default, students have to earn at least one star on a lesson to move on to the next one, however, this setting can be customized:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and open your class.</li>
   <li>Click the <b>Student Settings</b> link.</li>
   <li>Choose the number of stars you'd like students to earn in order to move forward from the dropdown menu. To save your settings, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click <b>Update Settings</b>.</li>
</ol>
