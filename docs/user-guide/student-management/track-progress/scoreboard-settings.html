<h3>Scoreboard and leaderboard settings</h3>

<p class="lead">The scoreboard is one of the motivational tools offered on TypingClub School Edition. It allows students in a given class to view each others' scores and try to outperform each other to grab the highest spot. If you prefer that students focus on their own individual performance instead, you can turn the scoreboard off.</p>

<h4>How do teachers manage the scoreboard?</h4>

<p>To turn on/off the scoreboard, go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and select your class. Under the <br/><span class="tab">Manage Class</span> tab, click <b>Edit Class</b> (the 5th option from the left). In the section titled <b>Scoreboard Visibility</b>, select your preferred behavior. To save your changes, click <b>Update Settings</b> at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<h4> How do teachers monitor the scoreboard?</h4>
<p>The scoreboard is a powerful tool that allows you to simultaneously view important details about all of your students progress on a given lesson plan. On one page, you will see each student's star count, practice time, average accuracy, average WPM, overall progress, and other details. To access the scoreboard, follow these steps:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and choose your class.</li>
		<li>Select the lesson plan tab you'd like to review.</li>
		<li>Click <b>Scoreboard</b>.</li>
	</ol>
<p>Your students&rsquo; scores will appear on this page as they work through the lesson plan. If you click the blue box titled <b>Per Lesson</b> at the end of each line, you will access the student's statistics for each individual lesson. </p>
