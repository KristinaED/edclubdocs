<h2>Getting students logged in to your school account</h2>

<p class="lead">Each school account has its own unique URL which was chosen when the account was created. To log in, all teachers and students should go to their school account's URL. All teachers sign in using their email address. Students can either use an email/username and password combo or a single sign on option.</p>

<p>Students can log in using the following options:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Username/email and password</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Assign each student a username/email and password when creating their profiles. Students will type in their full username or email and password.</li>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Google Single Sign On</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Include your students' Google email address in the email field when creating their profiles.</li>
		</ul>
	<li><b>Microsoft 365 Single Sign On</b></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Include your students' Microsoft 365 email address in the email field when creating their profiles.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Having trouble logging in? Try the following steps.</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Check the URL.</li>
		<p>When your school signed up for TypingClub, the account creator chose a unique portal URL for all teachers and students to use when logging in. It looks something like <b class="ed-bold-txt" style="color:#007ec6">http://school-name.typingclub.com</b>, where <b>school-name</b> is your school's name or your district's name. <br> 

		<div class="doc-notice">
    		<b>Note:</b>
    		You will not be able to sign in at www.typingclub.com with your school account credentials.
		</div>

	<li>Double check your login method.</li>
		<p>Check with your admin or teacher to find out if you should be typing in your username/email and password or using one of the Single Sign On methods such as Google or Microsoft 365.</p>

	<li>Make sure you have been added to your school's TypingClub account.</li>
		<p>Teachers and students must be registered with their school's account and enrolled in a class before they can start working on their lessons. If teachers are having trouble with either of these two steps, we have some helpful advice in the related help topics.</p>
