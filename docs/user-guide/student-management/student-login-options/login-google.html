<h1>Logging in to TypingClub with Google</h1>
<p>Teachers and students can log in to your TypingClub School account using their Google accounts.
   To allow your teachers and students to log in with Google, include their Google email address in the <b>Email</b> field when creating their profiles. When you roster students from Google Classroom, this is done automatically. Students do not need to have access to email in order to use Google Single Sign On.

      <b>Tip:</b>You do not need to add a username or password if students will log in with single sign on.
