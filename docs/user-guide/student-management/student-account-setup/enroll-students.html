<h1>Enrolling students in classes</h1>
<p>The School Edition of TypingClub allows you to upload your students and enroll them in classes. Getting a student set up is a two step process:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Upload the student to your account.</li>
   <li>Enroll the student in a class.</li>
</ol>
<p>If a student is in your account but is not enrolled in a class, they will not have any lessons to work on. To fix this, enroll your student in a class. Go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab to create new classes and enroll your students in it.</p>
<p>TypingClub School Edition lets your students join your account with a sign-up link. You can set up classes that allow students to enroll themselves.</p>
<p>Keep reading for step-by-step instructions on three different methods for enrolling students in classes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Manual Setup</h2>
<ol>
   <li>Add Your Classes. </li>
   <li>Import your students to your account.</li>
   <li>Assign your students to  classes.</li>
   <li>Either print out or email the login instructions for each student.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2>Semi-Manual Setup</h2>
<p>Use this option if you have imported your student list, but do not want to enroll students manually.</p>
<ol>
   <li>Add Your Classes. Make sure each class is configured to allow students to join it. To enable this, go to <span class="tab">classes</span> and click on <b>edit class.</b> Scroll down to <b>How should students join this class?</b> Select the <b>Any student in my account may join</b> option.</li>
   <li>Import your students to your account.</li>
   <li>Instruct your students to sign in and join their class by clicking <b>join.</b> on the correct lesson plan.</li>
   <li>You can view what classes your students have joined, remove them from a class if they joined accidentally, or manually add students to other classes yourself.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2>Easy Setup</h2>
<p>This is the most flexible option that will give your students the freedom to sign up by themselves and join their own classes. This option offers a very easy setup process while allowing you to still have full control over who can join your account and enroll in each class. This can be a great option in a library setting where you might want to allow students to sign up on their own and compete with classmates, while you track their progress.</p>
