<h2>Enrolling students in classes</h2>

<p>The School Edition of TypingClub allows you to upload your students and enroll them in classes. Getting a student set up is a two step process:</p>

<style>
.pad-around{padding:20px;}
.marg-top{margin-top:10px;}
.fnt-lrg{font-size:12pt;font-weight:thin;line-height:1.5em;}
.fnt{font-family:open sans;}
</style>

<ol>
	<li>Upload the student to your account.</li>
	<li>Enroll the student in a class.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a student is in your account but is not enrolled in a class, they will not have any lessons to work on. To fix this, enroll your student in a class. Go to the <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Classes</span> tab to create new classes and enroll your students in it.</p>

<p>TypingClub School Edition lets your students join your account with a sign-up link. You can set up classes that allow students to enroll themselves.</p>

<p>Keep reading for step-by-step instructions on three different methods for enrolling students in classes.</p>

	<h5>Easy Setup</h5>
	<p>This is the most flexible option that will give your students the freedom to sign up by themselves and join their own classes. This option offers a very easy setup process while allowing you to still have full control over who can join your account and enroll in each class. This can be a great option in a library setting where you might want to allow students to sign up on their own and compete with classmates, while you track their progress.</p>
