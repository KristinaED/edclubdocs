      <p>To adjust student settings for a class, go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab, click the name of the class you'd like to edit, and then click <b>Student Settings</b>. The preferences set from the teacher portal will be set for the entire class and won't be adjustable by students. For example, if you set the virtual keyboard to <i>Show</i>, your students will see the keyboard and won't have the option to hide it.</p>
