<h2>Student Settings</h2>

<p class="lead">Teachers and students have access to personalize the student experience of TypingClub.</p>

<h3>Student control of settings</h3>
<p>To customize their experience, students can access their settings while in a lesson. Students can choose a theme, change their font face or size, toggle voice over on/off, and customize the hand and keyboard guides. 

<div class="doc-tip">
	<b>Tip:</b>
	Please note that not all lessons contain the settings bar. For example, a game or a video doesn't give students the option to customize their preferences.</p>

<h3>Teacher control of student settings</h3> 
<h4>Per class</h4>
<p>Teachers have the option to set and/or lock certain student settings directly from their teacher portal. Here is a list of the settings teachers can change for each class:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Daily/weekly time goals</li>
	<li>Minimum star requirement to pass a lesson</li>
	<li>Virtual keyboard guides</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Visibility</li>
			<li>Language</li>
			<li>Layout</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Virtual hand guides</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Visibility</li>
			<li>Right hand/left hand</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Voice over</li>
	<li>Lock themes</li>
	<li>Lock font</li>
	<li>Lock replay button</li>
</ul>

<p>To adjust student settings for a class, go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab, click the name of the class you'd like to edit, and then click <b>Student Settings</b>. The preferences set from the teacher portal will be set for the entire class and won't be adjustable by students. For example, if you set the virtual keyboard to <i>Show</i>, your students will see the keyboard and won't have the option to hide it.</p>
