<h1>How can I activate placement tests for Typing Jungle?</h1>
</br>
<p>Teachers can utilize placement tests to assess where students' current touch typing abilities are. 
A placement test can be assigned to a class by following these steps:</p><br>
<ol>
<li>Select the <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Classes</span> tab on the left side of your dashboard</li> 
<li>Select your class</li>
<li>Click the <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Lesson Plans</span> link</li>
<li>For each lesson plan, you will see a column labeled <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Placement</span> which will allow you to enable/disable a placement test</li>
<li>Click 'Update' to save your changes 
</ol>
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that placement tests are available only on updated versions of Typing Jungle. To check if your copy is up to date, go to <b>Lesson Plans -> Typing Jungle</b>.
