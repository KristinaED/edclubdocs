<h1>How do I assign a specific group of lessons?</h1>
<br>
<p>You can limit which lessons your students have access to on a given lesson plan by assigning a group of lessons. This will help keep the class together and ensure that they are focusing on a given skill or area.</p>

<p>Click the <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Classes</span> tab on the left side of the screen. Choose the class of interest and select "Lesson Plans". In line with each lesson plan you will see the option to "Limit Progress".</p>

</br>

<p><h6>Step 1:</h6> Click the link that says "Not Limited". Enter the lesson numbers you'd like to assign to your class:</br>
