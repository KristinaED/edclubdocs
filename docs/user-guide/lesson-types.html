<h1>What types of lessons are available?</h1>
</br>
<h3>Standard Typing</h3>
<p>Standard typing lessons use the regular typing engine you are familiar with.</p>

<h3>Block Typing</h3>
<p>Block Typing places each character in an individual box. These lessons are helpful for introducing new characters because they allow students to pay proper attention to each key.</p>

<h3>Anchoring Lessons</h3>
<p>Anchoring lessons are a great tool to reinforce proper typing technique. Students are prompted to hold down the J or F key while practicing letters on the opposite side of the keyboard. When creating custom anchoring lessons, be sure to only use keys located on one side of the keyboard, depending on which key (J or F) is anchoring the other hand.</p>

<h3>Games</h3>
<p>Games are plugged directly into Typing Jungle. They are an integral part of the lesson plan and are customizable just like a regular typing lesson. You can customize the text and passing requirements.</p>

<h3>Videos</h3>
<p>Videos are also plugged directly into Typing Jungle.  They're both instructional and entertaining, and cover topics such as typing basics, good posture, and remembering to take breaks. These videos aim to keep your students engaged and excited about progressing through their lessons. When creating a custom lesson plan, you can add videos exactly as you would add any other lesson. If you find them distracting, simply delete the video lesson.</p>

<h3>Animated Story Typing</h3>
<p>Animated stories create a dynamic, creative environment for students to practice their typing. Students see a story develop as they type, and this immersive experience makes students feel like they are writing their own short story. The animated story typing videos are not plugged into Typing Jungle and are accessible as separate lesson plans. </p>
