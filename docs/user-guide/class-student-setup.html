<h2>Section 4: Class &amp; Student Setup</h2>
<p> The fourth section of the User Guide goes over the initial class and student setup process. Students in TypingClub are organized in classes and classes can have multiple lesson plans assigned to them. To ensure a smooth setup experience, it's paramount to create classes first and students second. In this section, we're going to cover the following topics: 

<div class="doc-quote">
<ul>
	<li> Creating classes individually and in bulk</li>
	<li> Managing lesson plans assigned to classes</li>
	<li> Creating original, custom lesson plans </li>
