<h1>Adding instructors individually</h1>
<p>TypingClub provides admins with powerful tools to populate their account. If only a small number of teachers needs to be added to an account, the easiest way is to add them one by one:</p>
<ol>
   <li> Select the <span class="tab">Instructors</span> tab.</li>
   <li> Click <b>Add Instructor</b>.</li>
   <li> Provide the instructor's full name and email address.</li>
   <li> Save your changes by clicking <b>Add Instructor</b>.</li>
</ol>
<div class="doc-notice">
   <b>Notice:</b>
   Admins do not set passwords for teachers. A welcome email will be sent to the provided email address inviting them to create a password and sign in.
</div>
<br/>
<h2> Adding instructors in bulk using Data Import Tool</h2>
<p>Start by clicking the <span class="tab">Settings</span> tab on the left-hand side of your admin portal and clicking <b>Data Import Tool.</b> The Data Import Tool is a powerful data processing tool which allows you to upload large amounts of data in a quick and organized manner. Simply prepare your spreadsheet with a .csv extension containing your teachers' information, or download our template  by clicking <b>Download Instructor CSV Template File.</b></p>
<p>Let's take a look at the required and optional fields for a successful upload:</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <h5>Required fields</h5>
   </li>
   <ul>
      <li><b>instructor-id:</b> your internal ID, no special form is required</li>
      <li><b>school-id:</b> required only if you have more than one school, no special form is required</li>
      <li><b>first name:</b> teachers' first names are required</li>

      <li><b>last name:</b> will help you more easily sort through your instructor list in the future</li>
      <li><b>phone:</b> will be helpful if you need to be able to quickly contact a teacher.</li>
      <li><b>password:</b> if your CSV doesn't contain teacher passwords, the instructors will be sent an email inviting them to set up their password.</li>
      <li><b>action:</b> use the word "update" for all rows in your spreadsheet to add or update instructors, or the word "delete" to remove them. </li>
   </ul>
</ul>
<div class="doc-warn">

<p>Once you have created your CSV file, make sure to save it, return to the Data Import Tool page, and upload the file. Uploading may take a couple of minutes depending on the size of the file. Check the <span class="tab">Instructors</span> tab to make sure the teachers from your spreadsheet have populated in your account.</p>
