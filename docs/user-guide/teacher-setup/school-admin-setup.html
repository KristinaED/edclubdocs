<h1>School admin setup</h1>
<p>Setting up a multi-school district account is a process that requires a few steps. TypingClub's administration portal provides admins with a powerful platform to do just that.</p>
<br/>
<h4> Step 1: Set up your schools</h4>
<p>If you're setting up your account for the whole district, you may want to add all schools at once using the Data Import Tool:</p>
<ol>
   <li> Start by clicking the  <span class="tab">Settings</span> tab.</li>
   <li> Open the <b>Data Import Tool.</b></li>
   <li> Follow the instructions on how to create and upload your CSV file. If you click <b>Schools</b> on the right-hand side of the screen, you'll be able to download a template.</li>
   <li>Once your CSV file is ready, click the <b>Choose File</b> button to upload it. Your file might take a few minutes to process, and you will see it labeled <i>Processing</i> on the bottom of the screen.</li>
   <li>Once it has been processed, your schools will automatically be added to your <span class="tab">Schools</span> section in the main menu.</li>
</ol>
<h4> Step 2: Appoint a school administrator</h4>
<p>Each TypingClub school can have one or more administrators who manage the school's data.
   To add a school admin, follow the next steps:
</p>
<ol>
   <li> Make sure that the future school admin already exists in your account as a teacher. (if not, add the teacher by going to <b>Instructors</b> <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span><b> Add instructor</b>).</li>
   <li> Go to the <span class="tab">Schools</span> tab.</li>
   <li> Click open the school of interest.</li>
   <li> Go to the <span class="tab">Admins</span> tab.</li>
   <li> Click <b>+ Add Administrator</b>.</li>
</ol>
