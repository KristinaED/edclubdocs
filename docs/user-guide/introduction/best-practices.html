<h2>Best practices for teaching keyboarding</h2>
<p>Although there are no official guidelines that dictate how you should teach keyboarding, we've put together a list of tips to help you manage your class:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Put your students' skills to the test</b>: Have students take the same test at regular intervals and watch their typing skills improve over time. Nothing is more motivating for your students than seeing their speed increase, and after a few months of diligent practice, they should notice that typing has become much easier.</li><br>
	<li><b>Allow corrections</b>: Backspace can be either enabled or disabled; the choice is yours. We recommend enabling it with beginners as the inability to correct mistakes could result in frustration. Advanced typists can disable the backspace to further challenge their typing skills.</li><br>
	<li><b>No need to look over their shoulders</b>: With the attempt playback feature, you can see what your students are typing, right from your own screen. This is especially useful if you suspect students might be getting help from their classmates or parents.</li><br>
	<li><b>Assign a range of lessons</b>: In order to ensure that your class stays together and that proper attention is given to each skill, use the <b>Assign a Range of Lessons</b> feature. Allow students to work within a given range of lessons and encourage them to repeat the lessons in order to earn all 5 stars on each lesson.</li><br>
	<li><b>Adjust the difficulty</b>: You can adjust difficulty on a student by student or class-wide basis. If a particular student is struggling or needs more of a challenge, you can adjust the WPM requirements to keep them engaged.</li><br>
	<li><b>Create cross-curricular content</b>: TypingClub's lesson plan editor allows you to create engaging cross-curricular content in a matter of minutes. While students are improving their typing, they can reinfornce their knowledge from other areas, too.</li>
