<h1> Keyboarding &amp; Common Core</h1>
<p>Computer literacy has become a core element of K-12 education, with students now expected to master keyboarding skills before college. In fact, several of the Common Core Standards require keyboarding. </p>
<p>TypingClub School Edition is designed to help your students meet and exceed the Common Core Standards within a semester's worth of time. Our test templates are deeply customizable so you can alter settings to best prepare your students. Once your students learn proper keyboarding technique, they can practice to increase typing speed, improve accuracy, and develop stamina for typing.</p>

            Academic integrity is one of the most important values we can instill in young students. Keyboarding lessens the physical burden of typing, thus making students less likely to copy-and-paste entire paragraphs.<br/>

            <b>Write routinely over extended time frames</b><br/> (time for research, reflection, and revision) and shorter time frames (a single sitting or a day or two).
            The only way to increase stamina is to practice typing passages of varying lengths. Our Typing Tests provide an excellent resource for this kind of practice.<br/>

   <b>Notice:</b> This calculation was made by assuming that a single sitting equals 30 minutes of continuous typing. The Common Core website is vague in its definition of 'a single sitting' so these benchmarks are estimates made by TypingClub.
