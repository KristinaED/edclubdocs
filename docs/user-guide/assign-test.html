<h1>How do I assign tests to students?</h1>
</br>
<p>You can do this by selecting the "Typing Tests" tab on the left side of the page, and clicking the test you want to assign. From the "Students" tab, you can assign an entire class by selecting "+ Add Students From a Class" and uploading the list.</p>

<p>Students can be assigned to a test individually </p>

<p>You can do this by selecting the "+ Lookup and Add Existing Students" button, and then entering any identifying information about the students, separated by a comma. This lookup wizard is designed to allow you to copy and paste lists of names or IDs from a spreadsheet directly into the search box.</p>

<p>Now that your students are assigned to a test, you can watch their hard work pay off in your results section!</p>
