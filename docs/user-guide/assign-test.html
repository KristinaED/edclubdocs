<h2>How do I assign tests to students?</h2>
<p>You can do this by selecting the <span class="tab">Typing Tests</span> tab on the left side of the page, and clicking the test you want to assign. From the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab, you can assign an entire class by selecting <b>+Add Students From a Class</b> and uploading the list.</p>
<p>Students can be assigned to a test individually. You can do this by selecting the <b>+ Lookup and Add Existing Students</b> button, and then entering any identifying information about the students, separated by a comma. This lookup wizard is designed to allow you to copy and paste lists of names or IDs from a spreadsheet directly into the search box.</p>
<p>Now that your students are assigned to a test, you can watch their hard work pay off in your results section!</p>
