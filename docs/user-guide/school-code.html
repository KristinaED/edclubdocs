<H2>What is my school code?</H2>
<p>If your school's login URL is <b> https://<mark class="gray-mark">schoolname</mark>.typingclub.com</b>, then your school code is <mark class="gray-mark">schoolname</mark>.
   Ask your teacher for your school code or URL, or you can look it up here:<br/><a href="https://s.typingclub.com/find-school-code.html" target="_blank">School Code Lookup</a>

<h3>Signing in using the EdClub iPad App</h3>
<p> The first time you open our EdClub app using an iPad, you will be prompted to enter a school code. The school code is the first part of your school's login URL. </p>
<p> For example, if your school's login URL is <b> https://<mark class="gray-mark">schoolname</mark>.typingclub.com</b>, then your school code is <mark class="gray-mark">schoolname</mark>.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Signing in using a Web Browser</h3>
<p>To sign in from a web browser such as Chrome, go directly to your school's login URL (for example: <b> https://schoolname.typingclub.com</b>). If you accidentally sign in at www.typingclub.com, we may be able to recognize that you belong to a school and ask you for a school code.</p>
