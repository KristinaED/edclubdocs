<h3>Creating Student Accounts</h3>
<p>If you need to add multiple students to your account, you can use one of the following two methods:<br/>
<ul>
   <li>
      <h4>Method 1: The Add Many Students Wizard </h4>
      <p><i>Best for small accounts with a few classes, rosters must be uploaded individually for each class.</i></p><br>
    
      <ol>
         <li>Go to the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab.</li>
         <li>Click <b>Add Many Students</b>. Here you can find instructions on how to format a CSV file containing your students' names and some identifying information.</li>
         <li>Click <b>Next Step</b> to get more information on how to create a CSV file. The following are the required fields for your preferred login setup:<br />
            Google SSO: first name, email<br/>
            Username/Password: first name, username, password
         </li>
         <li> Upload your CSV file, click <b>Choose File</b> and select the CSV file containing the properly formatted list of your students and their information.</li>
         <li>Click <b>Next</b> to preview your roster. </li>
         <li>If you have imported a single class, you may enroll all students to a class you have already created. This is optional and all students can be enrolled in classes later.</li>
         <li>If you are a district administrator and you have added schools to your account, you can choose a school for the students here.</li>
         <li>Click <b>Finalize Import</b>. You will now see all of the students from your CSV file appear under the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab. </li>
      </ol>
   </li>
   <br/>
   <li>
      <h4>Method 2: Data Import Tool </h4>
      <p>
         <i> Best for large accounts and districts, student IDs and class IDs are required for a successful upload of all students at once. </i>
      </p>
      <p>Go to <span class="tab">Settings</span> and scroll down to click the <b>Data Import Tool</b>. Here you can see the link on the right side of the screen titled <b>Students</b>. Clicking this link will give you information for required fields in the students.csv file. You can download a template by clicking <b>Download Student CSV Template File</b>.</p>
      <p>Let's take a look at the fields required for a successful upload:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
            <h5>Required fields:</h5>
         </li>
         <ul>
            <li><b>student-id:</b> your internal ID, no special form is required </li>
            <li><b>class-id:</b> required if you want to automatically enroll students in their respective classes. Make sure that class IDs have been properly assigned.</li>
            <li><b>school-id:</b> required only if you have more than one school</li>
            <li><b>first name:</b> students' first names</li>
            <li><b>username <i>or</i> email</b>: if students log in with a single sign-on, email must be entered. If no email address is provided, please add a username and a password.</li>
         </ul>
         <br>
         <li>
            <h5>Optional fields:</h5>
         </li>
         <ul>
            <li><b>last name:</b> students' last names</li>
            <li><b>password:</b> if students log in with a single sign-on, they will log in with their secure password (TypingClub doesn't store them). To log in with username/password, please add a password.</li>
            <li><b>grade</b>: including a grade will help you more easily sort through your classes in the future</li>
            <li><b>action:</b> use the word "update" for all rows in your spreadsheet to add or update student information, or the word "delete" to remove it. </li>
         </ul>
      </ul><br>
      <p>Once you have created your csv file, make sure to save it, return to the Data Import Tool page, and upload the file. Uploading may take a couple of minutes depending on the size of the file. Check the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab to make sure that students from your spreadsheet have populated in your account, and the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab to verify that students are properly enrolled in their respective classes.</p>
   </li>
</ul>
