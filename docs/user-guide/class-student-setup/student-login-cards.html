<h1>Student login cards</h1>
<p>Once your students are set up in your TypingClub account and enrolled in a class, you can create customizable login cards to help them sign in.</p>
<br/>
<ul>
   <li>
      <h2> Method 1: Generate login instructions</h2>
      <p>First, go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab, choose your class by clicking its name and go to <b>Print Login Cards</b>. You can choose which information to include and add a custom note. Click <b>Generate Printable Page</b> to view and print the PDF. Now, you can print out the sheet and hand out the login cards to your students. </p>
      <div class="doc-tip"><b>Tip:</b> If your students are using Google email addresses or Microsoft 365 Single Sign On, it might be helpful to uncheck every box except the login URL and write "Please log in using your Google/Microsoft account".</div>
   </li>

   <li>
      <h2>Method 2: Email login instructions </h2>
      <p>To send an email to each student with their individual login instructions, you must make sure that your students have email addresses associated with their accounts. If so, go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab, and select the class of interest. Then click the <b>Email Students</b> link to see the list of email addresses to which the instructions will be sent. Here you can also view and edit the template of the email itself. Then simply click <b>Email Students</b> and the email will be automatically sent. </p>

      <h2>Method 3: Individual distribution</h2>
      <p>To check or edit student login information individually, search the student's name using the search box in the top right corner. Click their name and then select the <span class="tab">Edit</span> tab. You will see the student's first and last name, as well as optional email address, username, password, grade, and school (if applicable).</p>
