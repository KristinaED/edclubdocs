<h3>Customize and create lesson plans <span class="icon-free"></span></h3>
<p>Teachers who use TypingClub School Edition have the ability to create and edit their own lesson plans. A lesson plan is a collection of lessons you see when students start using TypingClub. Everything about the lessons, including text, score system, use of backspace, and speed requirements is configurable in this interface. You can use our default lesson plan, you can edit it to match your personal preferences, or you can build a new lesson plan from scratch. </p><br/>
<h4>Default Lesson Plan - Typing Jungle</h4>
<p>Start by clicking the <span class="tab">Lesson Plans</span> tab. You should see the title <b>Typing Jungle</b>, which is TypingClub's default lesson plan. The first lessons instruct students to practice typing the [J] and [F] keys. These two keys are the foundation of touch typing (notice your keyboard has bumps on those letters). Each subsequent lesson introduces students to new letters, the [Shift] key, numbers, symbols, and motivates students to increase typing accuracy and speed.</p>
<p> With over 650 in-house designed lessons, Typing Jungle is a comprehensive resource and the best way to teach touch typing. It provides an extensive
curriculum that includes varied typing experiences, games, and videos, as well
as multiple motivational tools. It is appropriate for K-12 students as it is fully
customizable.</p>

<h4>Customizing Lesson Plans</h4>
<p>If you decide to use our default lesson plan but want to edit certain preferences, we recommend creating a duplicate of the lesson plan before making changes. That way you can go back to the default settings if something goes wrong. Do this by clicking <b>Duplicate</b> on the right side of the window.
</p>

<p> Everything about a lesson plan is customizable. As soon as you open the lesson plan, you'll be able to edit it using our powerful lesson plan editor. You will see that you have the power to edit the lesson name, the grading requirements such as the speed goal, minimum accuracy, and minimum WPM, the text that students type, preview lessons, and move them around. </p>
