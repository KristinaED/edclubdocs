<h3>Types of Lessons Available on TypingClub</h3>
<p> TypingClub is one of the most flexible and engaging typing platforms. It provides a wide array of lessons during typing practice. Students are constantly challenged with a new type of exercise which ultimately results in better outcomes in terms of typing proficiency. Let's take a look at the types of lessons available on TypingClub:</p>
<ol><br/>
<li>
   <h4>Standard Typing</h4>
   <p>Standard typing lessons use the regular typing engine you are familiar with. The font face as well as the font size can be customized.</p>

   <h4>Block Typing</h4>
   <p>Block Typing places each character in an individual box. These lessons are helpful for introducing new characters because they allow students to pay proper attention to each key.</p>

   <h4>Anchoring Lessons</h4>
   <p>Anchoring lessons are a great tool to reinforce proper typing technique. Students are prompted to hold down the J or F key while practicing letters on the opposite side of the keyboard. When creating custom anchoring lessons, be sure to only use keys located on one side of the keyboard, depending on which key (J or F) is anchoring the other hand.</p>

   <h4>Videos</h4>
   <p>Videos are also plugged directly into Typing Jungle.  They're both instructional and entertaining, and cover topics such as typing basics, good posture, and remembering to take breaks. These videos aim to keep your students engaged and excited about progressing through their lessons. When creating a custom lesson plan, you can add videos exactly as you would add any other lesson. If you find them distracting, simply delete the video lesson.</p>

   <h4>Animated Story Typing</h4>
   <p>Animated stories create a dynamic, creative environment for students to practice their typing. Students see a story develop as they type, and this immersive experience makes students feel like they are writing their own short story. The animated story typing videos are not plugged into Typing Jungle and are accessible as separate lesson plans. Three stories are currently offered and available to install from your Lesson Plan Library: Going Solo, Ava &amp; The Rabbit, and The Perfect Match. </p>
