<H2>How do I add multiple classes?</H2>
<p>When setting up a larger account, you may wish to use our Data Import Tool to add multiple classes at once instead of adding them one-by-one.</p>
<div class="doc-tip">
   <b>Tip:</b>
   Before adding new classes, check your current default lesson plan (Typing Jungle is assigned by default). This is the lesson plan that will be assigned to all newly created classes. To find this, go to <span class="label label-primary ed-label">Lesson Plans</span> and then Lesson Plan Settings.
</div>
<p>Start here:</br> 
   <b>Settings <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> Data Import Tool <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> Classes</b>
</p>
<p>Here, you can learn about required &amp; optional fields and download a classes.csv template.
   <br/>Let's take a look at the fields for a successful upload:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <h5>Required fields:</h5>
   </li>
   <ul>
      <li><b>class-id:</b> your internal ID, no special form is required </li>
      <li><b>instructor-id:</b> your internal ID, no special form is required</li>
      <li><b>school-id:</b> required only if you have more than one school, no special form is required</li>
      <li><b>name:</b> your internal class name</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   <li>
      <h5>Optional fields:</h5>
   </li>
   <ul>
      <li><b>description:</b> will help if you need to remember the purpose of each class</li>
      <li><b>grade:</b> including a grade the will help you more easily sort through your classes in the future</li>
      <li><b>action:</b> use the word update for all rows in your spreadsheet to add or update classes, or the word delete to remove them. </li>
   </ul>
</ul>
<p>Save your CSV, return to the Data Import Tool page, and upload the file. Uploading may take a couple of minutes depending on the size of the file.</p>
<div class="doc-warn">
   <b>Warning:</b>
   You still have to enroll your students in their classes. By assigning IDs to your classes, you can create and enroll your students at the same time. Be sure to include the class ID for each student when importing your students.csv file.
