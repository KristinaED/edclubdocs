<h1>Enroll students</h1>

<p>Each student must be enrolled in a class in order to have lessons to work on. Depending on the method you choose to create your student accounts, this can be a one step process (Google Classroom, class codes, Add Many Students Wizard one roster at a time) or it can be a two-step process in which you add classes and then enroll students.</p>

<br/>
<h2>Enroll students using Google Classroom</h2>
      <p>
         <i>Rostering from Google Classroom will both create your student accounts and roster your classes in one step. If your students have already been added to your TypingClub account using their Google email addresses, it will enroll them in their classes.</i>
