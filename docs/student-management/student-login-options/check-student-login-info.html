<h3>Method 2: Generate a Student .csv file</h3>

You can use this .csv to quickly reference each student's login credentials as needed. To generate the .csv file, go to the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab and click <b>Export CSV</b> You can use the filters on the student tab to narrow down the list before you export or use your preferred spreadsheet software to filter the data.</p>
