<h1>Missing progress</h1>
<p>Students often spend time practicing at home, but when they log back into their accounts at school, no practice time is recorded. This experience can be frustrating for students who understandably want to get credit for their work. In our experience, this problem is almost always caused by students going to the wrong website when they practice from home. Students should always log in to their personalized web portal.</p>

   <b>Tip:</b>
   Students who notice practice time not being recorded when they practice from home are likely to be accidentally logging in from the public-facing website, <a target="blank" href="www.typingclub.com">www.typingclub.com</a>, where their progress is not recorded under your school account.

<p>Even though progress can't be transferred over to your school account, teachers can have students skip to the level they last completed on www.typingclub.com.</p>
