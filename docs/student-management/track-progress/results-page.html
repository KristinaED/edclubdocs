<ul>
    <li><h5>Stars</h5>
        Stars are awarded based on a student's performance in each lesson. They are used to control whether the student can move on to the next lesson, or must retry for a better score.</li><br/>

    <li><h5>Score</h5>
        When a student finishes a lesson, their accuracy and WPM are sent to our calculation engine which produces an overall score.</li><br/>

<li><h5>Your Score</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Accuracy: Your corrected accuracy taking into account errors and corrections</li>
        <li>Real Accuracy: Your uncorrected, raw accuracy</li>
        <li>Speed: Measurement of your typing speed</li>
        <li>Duration: Total time you spent typing the lesson</li>
    </ul></li><br/>

<li><h5>Requirements</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Accuracy: Minimum accuracy to pass the lesson</li>
        <li>Speed: Minimum WPM required to pass the lesson</li>
        <li>Speed Goal: The ideal speed at which you should type the lesson</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>How can students improve their score?</h3>
    <ul>
    	<li>Focus on accuracy before attempting speed. There is a double-penalty in the score's accounting for every error.</li>
    	<li>Although you may be able to use backspace to correct your mistakes, there is a small penalty applied to your score if the error is made in the first place.</li>
    	<li>Once you have a handle on the accuracy, the only way to increase your score is to work on your speed.</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

<h3>How can students earn the Perfect Score?</h3>
<p>The Perfect Score can be achieved by typing at approximately 2.5 times the lesson's WPM Goal and near perfect accuracy.</p>

<br/>
<h3>How can I modify lesson requirements to change the number of stars my students are earning?</h3>
 <p>Each lesson has a defined minimum WPM and accuracy required to pass. Instructors can modify that requirement to customize the difficulty of each lesson.</p>
<br/>
<h3>How can I change the number of stars required for students to pass their lessons?</h3>
<p>Instructors can change the minimum number of stars required to pass on a class-by-class basis. To adjust this setting, go to the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab, select your class, and then click <b>Student Settings</b>. Use the drop-down menu to select the number of stars students should earn in order to pass a lesson.</p>
