<h1>Export student CSV</h1>
<p>If you would like to export students from your TypingClub account to a .csv file, you can do so by going to the <span class="tab">Students</span> tab on the left side of the screen. This can be useful if you'd like to update your student records without starting over from the beginning.</p>
