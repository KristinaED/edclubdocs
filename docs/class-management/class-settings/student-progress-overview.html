   <li>Click <b>Student Progress.</b> You will see your students listed alphabetically by last name in the column on the left side, and the lesson number on the top row of the chart. The blue boxes represent a completed lesson in which the student has earned 5 stars. <br/>Any shade of grey represents 4 stars or less. You can hover over each lesson to see more information about the student's performance.<br/> Ideally, you will see a completely blue chart indicating that every student repeated each lesson until they achieved 5 stars and they have each finished all the lessons up to the point you assigned.</li>
