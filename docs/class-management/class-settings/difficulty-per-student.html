<h3>Adjusting difficulty level per student</h3>
<p>The lesson difficulty progressively increases by default. The passing requirements are low in the early lessons and gradually rise as students progress further in the lesson plan. If the default settings don't match your students' skill level, you can customize them by following the next steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and choose the student's class.</li>
<li>Select the tab that corresponds to the lesson plan of interest.</li>
<li>If you click the <b>Scoreboard</b>, you will see the list of enrolled students and their ranking in the class.</li>
<li>Find the student, go to the column labeled <b>Difficulty</b> and click <b>Normal Difficulty</b>. You can adjust the difficulty in terms of either accuracy or words per minute (WPM).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li>
<p><b>Adjust difficulty by Words per Minute (WPM)</b>: Use the arrows to add or subtract from the words per minute requirement for this student. If you change this setting to +1, you will make it more difficult for the student, whereas if you change it -1, you will make it easier.<br>
For example, if a lesson requires a speed of 15 words per minute, adding +1 will require this student to type at a speed of 16 words per minute. This requirement will apply to all lessons in this lesson plan for this student.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
 <p><b>Adjust the required minimum accuracy</b>: Enter the minimum accuracy for your students to earn one star. If your students perform below this value, they will not pass the lesson.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
