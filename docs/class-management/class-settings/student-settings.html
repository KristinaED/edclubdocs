<h2>How can teachers control student settings?</h2>
<h3> How can students access their settings?</h3>
<p>To customize their experience, students can access their settings from a lesson view. Please note that not all lessons contain the settings bar. For example, a game or a video doesn't give students the option to customize their preferences.</p>

<h3> How can teachers lock student settings?</h3>
<p>Teachers have the option to lock student settings directly from their teacher portal. To adjust student settings for a class, go to your class management page, click "Edit Class" and "Lock Student Settings". The preferences set from the teacher portal will be set for the entire class and won't be adjustable by students. For example, if you set the virtual keyboard to "Show", your students will see the keyboard and won't have the option to hide it.</p>
