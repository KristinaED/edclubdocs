<h3>Managing the jump-ahead behavior</h3>
<p>The default settings don't allow students to jump ahead in the lesson plan. We believe that students should practice lesson in order to get the most out of the program. If you prefer that your students have the freedom to jump around the lesson plan, please follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Click the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab on the left side of the screen.</li>
   <li>Click on the class for which you would like to change this setting.</li>
   <li>Under the <span class="tab">Manage Class</span> tab, click on the <span class="tab">Edit Class</span> sub-tab. This will be the 5th link from the left.</li>
   <li>Scroll down until you see <b>Allow Jumping Ahead.</b> This is near the bottom of the page.</li>
   <li>Select your preferred behavior.</li>
   <li>To save your changes, press <b>Update Settings</b> at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ol>
