<h1>Archive classes</h1>
<p> Teachers have the ability to pause classes by archiving them. This is helpful when teachers want to pause the class but still preserve the roster, the class settings, and lesson plans assigned. When you disable a class, students will not be able to access the lesson plans that are assigned to that class. You can use this feature to either hide certain lesson plans from students or to preserve a roster for a later date.</p>
