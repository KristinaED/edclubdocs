<h2>Assigning tests to students</h2>
<p>Once you've created a test, you need to assign it to your students. This is a two step process explained below:</p>
<ol>
	<li><h4>Select who can take the test</h4>
    <p>You can do this by selecting the <span class="tab">Typing Tests</span> tab on the left side of the page, and clicking the test you want to assign. From the <span class="tab">Edit Options</span> tab, you can select who can take the test:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li><b>Only the students I select</b>: You will need to manually choose students to take the test.</li>
    	<li><b>Any student in my school</b>: Students from your school will need to sign up for the test from their student portal. When they log in, they will see a button labeled <b>Add more activities (1)</b>. They must click this button to access the test.</li>
    	<li><b>Any student in my account</b>: Students will need to sign up for the test from their student portal. When they log in, they will see a button labeled <b>Add more activities (1)</b>.  They must click this button to access the test.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h4>Assign the test to select students and classes</h4>
    	<p>If you chose the first option, the next step is to select students who can take the test. To do this, click on <span class="tab">Students</span> and search for each student individually, or assign the test to an entire class.</p>
