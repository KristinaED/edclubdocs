<h1>Create typing tests<span class="icon-pro"></span></h1>
<p>Typing tests allow you to monitor your students' performance in a timed examination where they have to type large quantities of text. This presents an alternative to the short lessons and can help prepare students for standardized tests like the Common Core.</p>
<br/>
<h2>How to create and customize a typing test</h2>
<p>Go to the <span class="tab">Typing Tests</span> tab and click <b>Add a Typing Test</b>. After you give the test a name and a brief description, you will be able to customize several settings.</p>
<div class="doc-tip">
   <b>Tip:</b>To better understand whether a certain test will be a good fit for your students, we recommend taking the test yourself before assigning it to a class.

      <h3>Print Certificates:</h3>
      Teachers have the option to print certificates of achievement at the end of a typing test. As of November 2016, certificates are issued by default. To ensure the option is turned on, the <span class="tab">Print Certificates</span> tab should appear on your top navigation bar.<br> For tests created prior, go back to <span class="tab">Edit Option</span> tab and turn the certificates of achievement on. You can export the certificates in a friendly PDF format and print them to provide further motivation for your students.
