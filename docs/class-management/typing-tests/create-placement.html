<h2>Creating placement tests in custom lesson plans</h2>
<p>Teachers have the ability to create placement tests in their custom lesson plans. Once created and assigned, the placement test will unlock skills that students are already proficient in. Remember that students will not receive credit for the unlocked lessons.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Create custom placement test</h3>
<p>Placement tests can be added to a lesson plan by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <span class="tab">Lesson Plans</span> tab.</li>
<li>Select the lesson plan. </li>
<li>Click the plus sign to add a new lesson</li> 
<li>Select a lesson type</li>
<li>Type your desired text and under the <i>Placement Test</i> section, click <b>Placement Test</b>.</li> 
<li>When you're finished, save the lesson by clicking <b>Done</b>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step 2: Assign custom placement test to your class</h3>
<p>Once the placement test has been created, you will go back to the specific class and enable it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab and select your class.</li> 
<li>Click <b>Lesson Plans</b> and find the custom lesson plan. You will see a column labeled <b>Placement</b> which will allow you to enable/disable the placement test you just created.</li>
<li>Click <b>Update</b> to save your changes.</li>
</ol>
