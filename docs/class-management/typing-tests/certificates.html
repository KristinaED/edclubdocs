<h3>Issuing certificates of completion <span class="icon-pro"></span></h3>
<p>Certificates are a great motivational tool that keeps students engaged throughout the typing course. Instructors can award certificates to students who either finish a test or meet a passing requirement for a test.</p>

<ul>
   <li>
      <h4>Certificate for finishing a test</h4>
      <p>Everyone who completes the test will both pass and be issued a certificate. This is useful if you are doing a placement test that doesn't have passing requirements.</p>
      <p>An easy way to check if your certificates are turned on is to see if you have a tab titled <br><span class="tab">Print Certificates</span> on the test management page:</p>
      <br/>
      <img src="{{ EDC_SRC }}media/screenshots/certificate-completion.png" style="width: 100%; border: 1px solid #ccc;"/>
   </li>
   </br>
   </br>
   <li>
      <h4>Certificate for meeting the passing criteria</h4>
      <p>Students must meet the passing requirements in order to be issued a certificate. The passing requirements can be customized.</p>

<p>As of November 2016, certificates are issued by default. If you created a test prior to November 2016, your certificates might not be turned on. You can edit your preferences by going to your test and clicking the <span class="tab">Edit Options</span> tab on the top. Among some other customizable settings, this page allows you to see if the <b>Certificates of Achievement</b> option is checked.</p>
<div class="doc-warn">
   <b>Warning:</b>
   Issuing certificates retroactively is not possible. Always remember to check the settings before your students take a test. Whenever you make changes, do not forget to click <b>Update Options</b> on the bottom of the page.
