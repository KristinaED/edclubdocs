<h2>Reset lesson plan progress</h2>
<p>TypingClub never deletes students' typing progress. Even when students come back from a summer break, they'll be able to continue working where they left off. If you prefer that students start back at lesson 1, you can reset their progress by following the next steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <span class="tab">Classes</span> and open your class.</li>
	<li>Click the lesson plan you'd like to reset.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Scoreboard</b>.</li>
	<li>Click <b>Clear Progress</b>.</li>
</ol>
