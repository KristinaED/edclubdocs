<h2>Assigning lesson plans</h2>
<p>Every TypingClub class has at least one lesson plan assigned, typically the default lesson plan Typing Jungle. However, teachers can assign as many lesson plans as they like. Learn how to assign lesson plans below:</p>
<br>
<ol>
   <li>Click the <span class="tab">Classes</span> tab.</li>
   <li>Choose the class of interest.</b>
   <li>Select <span class="tab">Lesson Plans</span> to see the lesson plans assigned to this class.</li>
   <li>Click the <b>+Assign lesson plan to this class</b> button and you will see a list of lesson plans which can be assigned to the class. The lesson plans that appear in this list are lesson plans that have been installed in your account. If you'd like to browse the Lesson Plan Library and possibly install new lesson plans, go to <b>Lesson Plans</b> <span class="icon-right-arrow"></span> <b>Lesson Plan Library</b>. Keep in mind that all lesson plans are available for download at no extra charge. 
   <li>When you're done selecting the lesson plan you wish to assign, click <b>Add Lesson Plans</b>.</li>
